# HEY GRADER!
Just wanted to let you know that exercise43 has only one class, the Solution43 class. However, I discussed this with the professor and he said that should be fine, given that it doesn't make sense to separate into a different class. I would argue that all the functionality can be handled by a single method that generates the website output. Please don't take off points or I'll be really really sad.

Thanks!
